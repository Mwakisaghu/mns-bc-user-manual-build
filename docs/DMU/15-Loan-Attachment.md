Before we proceed, let's familiarize ourselves with some key terms:

- **Defaulted Loan**: A loan for which a member has failed to make timely payments over a specified period.
- **Attached Loan**: Liabilities transferred from the principal borrower to guarantors of the respective loan.

### Attachment Process <a name="attachment-process"></a>

### Viewing Defaulter Details

Attachment begins with identifying defaulted loans and selecting those eligible for attachment. You can search for defaulter details using various criteria such as member number, name, loan number, etc.

:::info To view defaulter details:

1. Navigate to the **Lists** section on the dashboard.
2. Select **Loan List**.
3. Apply filters to display defaulted loans only.

### Display and Processing of Attachment

Once defaulter details are identified, the system displays member and loan details for attachment. Key functions include:

- Automatic recovery of deposits to defaulted loans.
- Prorating deposits among the member's BOSA loans.
- Attachment of loans among guarantors based on the original loan percentage.
- Automatic recovery of attached FOSA loans from salary postings.

### Loan Attachment Details

Attached loans are assigned alphanumeric loan numbers for guarantors, ensuring clear identification. Principal and interest are posted separately on guarantor loan accounts, maintaining accuracy and transparency.

- ### Automated Functions <a name="automated-functions"></a>

The system facilitates rapid transaction posting and prevents double posting with balance checks. It prioritizes deposit recovery and adjusts balances automatically between defaulter and guarantor accounts.

- ### Transaction Handling <a name="transaction-handling"></a>

Transactions are handled meticulously, ensuring separate recovery of principal and interest on attached loans. All transactions have a double-entry system for accuracy, and interest repayments take precedence for all attached loans.

---

### Messaging and Alerts <a name="messaging-and-alerts"></a>

Upon attachment, the system sends automatic SMS notifications to both the defaulter and guarantors. Customizable message templates provide flexibility, and message records are stored for future reference.

### Account Management <a name="account-management"></a>

The system enables efficient management of attached loans, retaining defaulter details and maintaining transaction history on reversals. Maker-checker control ensures accountability, allowing for flagging/unflagging of member accounts.
