# ðŸ“… Payment Schedule Configuration in Dynamics 365 Finance

In Dynamics 365 Finance, the setup of payment schedules plays a pivotal role in managing customer payments efficiently. Before delving into the configuration process, it's important to note that certain payment setups are shared between Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable, including payment days, payment schedules, terms of payment, and cash discounts.

## Understanding Payment Schedules

Payment schedules enable the acceptance of customer payments in installments, providing flexibility and convenience. Here's what you need to define when setting up a payment schedule:

A payment schedule comprises consecutive payments in specified time intervals, which can either be a set amount or a specified number of payments with equal amounts.

- **Total:** Pays the total outstanding amount on the invoice.
- **Fixed Amount:** Specifies a fixed amount for each payment.
- **Fixed Quantity:** Divides the total amount into a fixed number of payments.
- **Specified:** Specifies a certain amount due on each specified payment date.

1. **Select Allocation Method:** Depending on the allocation method chosen, different fields are enabled on the General and Payment lines FastTabs.

2. **Define Payment Interval:** Specify the payment interval (Days, Months, or Years) on the General FastTab.

3. **Sales Tax Allocation:** Use the Sales tax allocation list to distribute the sales tax amount to the payment schedule installments if necessary.

4. **Define Payment Lines:** On the Payment lines FastTab, define the line information for the payment schedule, including the quantity and amount for each installment. 

5. **Set Amount or Quantity:** Enter the time interval for each installment in the Quantity field and the value of the installment in the Amount in transaction currency field. Select whether the value entered is a percent or an absolute amount.

6. **Complete Setup:** Save the payment schedule configuration.

These configurations ensure accurate calculation of due dates and streamline payment processes. Let's explore how to set up terms of payment and payment days effectively:
